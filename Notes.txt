- Timing and demostrator system
- gain some insight into the challenges of
particle accelerators, aspects of their control and their timing and sensing
synchronization
- try and get the particles moving or adjusting their speed
by controlling the magnets
- being able to characterise the particles
that have been put in the accelerator
- cycling accelerator
- enclosed track, nothing flying out
- even slight acceleration is fine

- track is plastic/PVC/perspex (transparent)
- ball bearings, encased in pjastic and plasticine (impact friction)
- detectors triggered when balls pass sensors
- sensor = laser LED and LDR
- magnets (2 or more)
- launch mechanism

- figure out timing of when object is detected by sensors and right time 
to activate magnets to increase speed

- STM (python/C)
- GPIO and veriboard/breadboard circuits to control FETS controlling
magnets/ when ball crosses laser detector
- connect to PC for config parameters and logging data
- times at which magnets are turned on/off and when Obs pass a
detection sensor and their speeds, and calculated acceleration 
or deacceleration
